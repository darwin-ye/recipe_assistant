## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Ollama** installed and running on your system.

1.  **Download Ollama:** Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/) and download the application for your operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).
2.  **Run the LLM:** Once Ollama is installed, open your terminal and pull the Llama 3 model by running:
    ```bash
    ollama run llama3
    ```
    This will download and run the model. Keep Ollama running in the background.

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/darwin-ye/recipe_assistant.git](https://github.com/darwin-ye/recipe_assistant.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd recipe_assistant
    ```
3.  Run the setup script to create a Python virtual environment and install all dependencies:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    This script will create a virtual environment named `langgraph_venv` and install `langgraph`, `langchain`, `langchain-ollama`, and other required packages.

### Usage

1.  Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source langgraph_venv/bin/activate
    ```
2.  Run the main application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The conversational agent will now be running in your terminal, guiding you through the recipe-finding process.

## üß† Workflow

The agent's logic is defined using a LangGraph state machine, which orchestrates a sequence of nodes to handle the conversation flow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for the agent.
- **LangGraph:** The framework for building and orchestrating the agent's stateful workflow.
- **LangChain:** Provides the essential abstractions and integrations for connecting to the LLM.
- **Ollama:** A powerful tool for running open-source LLMs locally.
- **Llama 3:** The Large Language Model used as the agent's core reasoning engine.

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Basic Recipe Creation
```
You: create a chicken pasta recipe
AI: [Generates complete recipe with ingredients and instructions]

You: scale it to 8 people
AI: [Automatically scales the current recipe]
```

### Natural Language Queries
```
You: show me the recipe I always have
AI: [Shows your most frequently created recipe]

You: how often do I use chicken?
AI: [Displays ingredient frequency analysis]

You: give me the previous salmon recipe
AI: [Retrieves specific historical recipe]
```

### Recipe Management
```
You: 2
AI: [Shows recipe #2 from recent list]

You: show recent recipes
AI: [Lists your most recent recipe creations]
```

## üîß Architecture
