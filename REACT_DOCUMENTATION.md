# ReAct Recipe Agent Documentation

## Overview

The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) Recipe Agent is a sophisticated AI system that combines structured reasoning with tool usage to provide comprehensive recipe assistance. This system has evolved from a simple recipe creator to a full-featured culinary assistant with analytics, natural language understanding, and contextual awareness.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SimpleReActAgent** (`simple_react_agent.py`)
   - Primary interface for user interactions
   - Hybrid rule-based + LLM intent detection
   - Direct database integration
   - Context-aware recipe operations

2. **ReActAgent** (`react_agent.py`)
   - Full ReAct implementation with 11 tools
   - Multi-step reasoning capabilities
   - External API integrations
   - Complex query handling

3. **Recipe Database** (`recipe_models.py`)
   - JSON-based recipe storage
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Recipe analytics and frequency tracking

4. **LangGraph Workflow** (`main.py`)
   - Conversation state management
   - Recipe context preservation
   - User interface handling

## Features

### 1. Recipe Creation
- AI-powered recipe generation using LLM
- Ingredient-based recipe suggestions
- Dietary restriction handling
- Automatic recipe storage and indexing

### 2. Recipe Management
- Search existing recipes by ingredients, names, or descriptions
- Retrieve detailed recipe instructions
- View recent recipes with chronological ordering
- Recipe scaling for different serving sizes

### 3. Analytics
- **Most Frequent Recipe Analysis**: Identifies the most commonly created recipes
- **Ingredient Count Analysis**: Counts recipes containing specific ingredients
- Historical recipe usage patterns

### 4. Natural Language Understanding
The system understands various ways users express their needs:

#### Recipe Creation Patterns:
- "create a chicken recipe"
- "give me a salmon recipe"
- "make something with pasta"
- "new recipe with beef"

#### Historical References:
- "show me the previous recipe"
- "give me the last chicken recipe"
- "my recent salmon dish"

#### Analytics Queries:
- "show me the recipe I always have"
- "what's my go-to recipe?"
- "how often do I use chicken?"
- "count recipes with beef"

#### Numbered References:
- "2" (refers to recipe #2 from recent list)
- "show me recipe 3"

### 5. Context Awareness
- Maintains current recipe context across conversation turns
- Enables immediate recipe scaling after creation
- Preserves recipe state for follow-up operations

## Intent Detection System

### Hybrid Approach
The system uses a two-tier intent detection:

1. **Rule-Based Patterns**: Fast matching for common queries using regex patterns
2. **LLM Fallback**: Advanced semantic understanding for edge cases

### Intent Categories

1. **analytics_frequent**: Most frequent recipe analysis
2. **analytics_count**: Ingredient frequency counting
3. **create_recipe**: New recipe generation
4. **get_recent**: Recent recipe listing
5. **get_details**: Recipe detail retrieval
6. **scale_recipe**: Recipe scaling operations
7. **search**: Recipe database search
8. **numbered_reference**: Direct recipe selection by number

## ReAct Tools Available
