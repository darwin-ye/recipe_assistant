    "raw_text": "Sun-Kissed Chicken and Tomato Fiesta\n\n**Serving size:** 4-6 people\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n* 2 large ripe tomatoes, diced\n* 1/4 cup olive oil\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, garlic, cumin, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and pepper.\n3. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n4. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 15-20 minutes before cooking.\n5. Place the chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving a little space between each piece.\n6. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for 20-22 minutes or until cooked through.\n7. While the chicken is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced tomatoes and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to release their juices and soften slightly.\n8. Once the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Then, add it to the skillet with the tomatoes.\n9. Stir gently to combine, allowing the chicken to absorb some of the tomato juices. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes or until heated through.\n10. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.\n11. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves (if using) and serve hot.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For a spicier dish, add diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers to the marinade or skillet with the tomatoes.\n* Substitute chicken thighs or a combination of breasts and thighs for different textures.\n* Add some crunch by sprinkling chopped pecans or almonds on top of the chicken before baking.\n* Serve with warm flour tortillas, over rice, or as part of a larger fiesta platter.\n\n**Food Safety Notes:**\n\n* Always handle raw poultry safely to avoid cross-contamination. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling the chicken and any utensils used in its preparation.\n* Cook the chicken to an internal temperature of at least 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n* Keep cooked chicken hot above 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) until serving, and refrigerate or freeze promptly if not consuming immediately."
