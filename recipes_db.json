Grill the chicken for 5-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate and let rest for a few minutes.\n5. Warm the tortillas by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20-30 seconds.\n6. Assemble the tacos by slicing the grilled chicken into thin strips and placing it onto a tortilla. Top with cilantro, green onions, kimchi slaw (if using), pickled carrots, and crispy garlic (if desired).\n\n**Important Food Safety Note:**\n\n* Always cook chicken to an internal temperature of at least 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For a spicy kick, add diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers to the marinade.\n* Substitute Greek yogurt or sour cream for the lime juice in the marinade for a creamier flavor.\n* Add some crunch by topping with toasted sesame seeds or chopped peanuts.\n* Experiment with different types of kimchi slaw or pickled carrots for added texture and flavor.\n\n**Note:** For kimchi slaw, mix 1 cup of store-bought or homemade kimchi with 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise and 1 tablespoon of lime juice. Refrigerate until ready to use."
